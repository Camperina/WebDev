# WebDev

The address to the homepage created in my Web Development class is http://mcs.athens.edu/~mcamp2/. 
From my homepage, you can access all of the webpages I created in class.

In this class we began by learning the basics of HTML the progressed through CSS, JavaScript, 
PHP, and MySQL. We had two class projects. All of these items are linked through my homepage.

I also proposed an updated website for a local company for a class assignment. I worked on this project with
a partner, Samiksha Pradhan. The website presentation listed separately from the homepage and other tasks.
